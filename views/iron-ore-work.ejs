            <h2>Mining & Extraction</h2>
            <p>
                The mining process involves the careful removal of iron ore deposits from the earth using eco-friendly and safe methods. Our team ensures minimal wastage and maximum efficiency through modern drilling, blasting, and excavation practices. By incorporating advanced machinery and skilled manpower, we maintain the highest levels of productivity while prioritizing the safety of workers and the surrounding environment.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once extracted, the iron ore undergoes preliminary screening to separate high-grade ore from impurities. Our operations are designed to maximize resource utilization and maintain the purity of the ore, ensuring better results in downstream industries like steel manufacturing.

            <h2>Processing & Grading</h2>
            <p>
                After extraction, iron ore is transported to our processing facilities where it is crushed, screened, and graded according to industry standards. This ensures consistency in quality and helps meet the specific requirements of our clients. We use high-end processing equipment to reduce impurities and enhance the iron content of the ore.  
            </p>
            <p>
                By maintaining strict quality checks during the grading process, we ensure that only the best material reaches the market. Our processing techniques are designed to improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste. This not only boosts profitability but also helps conserve natural resources.
